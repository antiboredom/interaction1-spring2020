<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>Through lectures and workshops you will learn the fundamental design principals and technologies required to make interactive artifacts. This class will focus on exploring networks not just as a series of technical tools and codes, but as a new landscape, a new public space, a new medium. This space is tremendously graphic, making designers the architects of this complex new public forum. Our focus will be to learn by doing: first-hand experience gained while undertaking hands-on exercises and real-world projects will provide the context and framework for discussion and instruction.</p>
<p>Work will be accomplished with tools and software you already have (Adobe Creative Suite) or can download and use for free (Visual Studio Code, FileZilla). Web browsers on desktop computers and mobile devices will also be used extensively.</p>
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>
  — to give students an understanding of how information is distributed online, and how good design can harness these modes of structuring information<br>
  — to discuss with the students how the web as a very specific public space, with its own communities, forms of engagement, modes of communication<br>
  — to familiarize students with the design principles relating to dynamic media<br>
  — to enable students to produce working prototypes of web pages<br>
  — to give students a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and supporting languages such as Javascript/Jquery<br>
  — to give students a firm understanding of the technology involved in implementing a website</p>
